# Show us your code

If you have existing code that you can share with us and are proud of, these exercises are optional—just send us a link to the repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.).

## RelayRides Code Exercises

If you are doing an exercise, you can pick any of the ones below.

### Front-end

#### Search

Build a single-page rental car search app using [Hotwire’s Shopping API][hotwire]. It requires registering for an API key, but it should only take 60 seconds to register your test application.

At a minimum, the user should be able to:

- search by date and location
- view results in a list
- click on a result to view more details about the car

We’ll be looking for clean, well-structured code and a polished user interface.

The choice of technologies (Angular, React, LESS, etc.) are up to you, but all projects should have a single `index.html` that loads scripts and stylesheets. Send us a link to your repository, as well as a hosted (Heroku, Google App Engine, Amazon EC2, etc.) version.

### Back-end

#### Simple Database

We really like [Thumbtack’s Simple Database Challenge][sdb]. We couldn’t put it better than they did, so just follow their instructions and send us a link to your repository.

### Acknowledgements

In addition to Thumbtack, we have taken a decent helping of inspiration from [Uber’s coding challenge][uber].
